<h1>Q ugg gillespie with Snider coach Kurt Tippmann

 </h1><p>Snider High School football coach Kurt Tippmann took his Panthers a step further in 2011 than they had been under his guidance before. After winning sectional championships in each of his first two seasons, Snider advanced to the semistate in 2011 with an impressive <strong>ugg clogs</strong> 3821 win over Hamilton Southeastern in the regional championship.</p>

<p>Coach Tippmann spoke recently with NewsSentinel sports editor Tom Davis.</p>

<p>NewsSentinel: What does Snider need to do either match last year's accomplishment or even advanced further?</p>

<p>Tippmann: Well, it's another year and a completely different team. We graduated a very talented senior class. Certainly we'll miss those guys, and now it's a new senior class with a different identity, a different team. How they establish the leadership within the group and their work ethic will really determine our season.</p>

<p>NewsSentinel: Is the SAC going to be more of the same with the same teams fighting near the top?</p>

<p>Tippmann: I think everybody is going to be better. Everybody is talented. A lot of the coaches have now been there a second year or third year. Everybody, I think, is improved. We have a balanced group this year. I'm expecting that everybody is going to be capable of beating anybody on a Friday night.</p>

<p>NewsSentinel: Who is going to be replacing the graduated (running back) John Nelson?</p>

<p>Tippmann: The offensive backfield, to begin with, is going to be kind of by committee. We have three seniors that are going to vie for that spot, and we're going to share a load until one of them surfaces. It is very conceivable <strong>uggs journeys</strong> that all three share the workload during the year, and they are Tyrell Swain, Je'Norie Smith and Nic Reese.</p>

<p>NewsSentinel: Your thoughts on quarterback Brandon Phelps?</p>

<p>Tippmann: He's returning for his senior year, so that always helps, having a guy with 14 games experience under his belt. He's been in some big games and had to make some plays in those big games.</p>

<p>NewsSentinel: Who will be catching the ball?</p>

<p>Tippmann: Our <strong>ugg boots yahoo answers</strong> leading receiver last year was our tight end, Addison Dellinger, and he's back. We have another tight end that is very talented in Josh Spitnale, who shared the load last year at tight end. On the outside are Quinton Daniels and Shaquan Scott, two seniors who have kind of waited their turn and now will have their number called.</p>

<p>NewsSentinel: What about the defensive side of <strong>discount uggs in canada</strong> the ball?</p>

<p>Tippmann: Kamen DowdellWhite is a guy that really shared time with (graduated Donte Bowen and Weston Painter) inside, so really, we return two starters inside. On the edge, Adam Whisler, a senior, has been waiting in the wings to get that job. Nic Reese is a twoyear returning starter at the outside linebacker. Dumont Schmidt played a lot last year. He'll be the general of the secondary as the safety. We are fortunate to have a group of about six seniors that are going to share the load back there.</p>

<p>NewsSentinel: As deep as the Snider program is, your practices have to prepare these kids for the opportunity to play when they are given the chance.</p>

<p>Tippmann: As a coaching staff, one of the things that we are looking forward to the most is having a senior class of 38 kids. That's 38 kids that have, for the most part, been in the <strong>ugg gillespie</strong> program for four years. On one side, that creates the problem of being able to give kids quality repetitions. But what we are able to do is be able to go against each other, and those kids have gotten those reps. To their credit, they have been patient.</p>Articles Connexesï¼š
