''It was great to be able to share the tremendous memories with him and some of our recent successes."<br><br>For most of his three decades with Navy, Mr. Belichick scouted the team's next opponent. ''He was a genius," Joe Bellino, winner of the Heisman Trophy in 1960 for Navy, told The New York Times last year.

''And he was a great man and he raised a great son."<br><br>Steve Belichick was a familiar face around Gillette Stadium and was the first person Bill Belichick embraced after New England's 2421 win over Philadelphia in February's Super Bowl, the team's third championship in four years.<br><br>Linebacker Tedy Bruschi doused the duo with a container of icycold liquid.<br><br>''I was coming up with the bucket and I saw Bill embracing his father. I thought, 'What a sweet moment. Aw, I'll get them both,' <strong>uggs return</strong> " Bruschi said yesterday.<br><br>''(Steve Belichick) was around a lot, but you had to sort of twist his arm to get a lot of words out of him. . . . Like father, like son," Bruschi said.<br><br>The elder Belichick, a Struthers, Ohio native, played football and basketball at Case Western Reserve University, graduating in 1941.<br><br>In 1941, he volunteered to be an equipment manager for the Detroit Lions and ended up a blocking back for a year for quarterback Byron ''Whizzer" White, who went on to become a Supreme Court Justice.<br><br>Mr. Belichick served in the Navy during World War II. After the war, he was head football, basketball, and track coach at Hiram College for three years. He was an assistant football coach <strong>uggs mens slippers</strong> at Vanderbilt and North Carolina, before moving to the Naval Academy in 1956.<br><br>He served under seven head coaches, helped coach two Heisman Trophy winners, and helped lead the Midshipmen to seven bowl games.
