<h1>Young sees season discount ugg kids end

 </h1><p>BY WILLIS JACOBSON</p>

<p>KEY WEST  The Key West High football team will go into its most important game of the year Friday night without one of its top allaround players.</p>

<p>Phillip Young, who had been a starter on offense, defense and <strong>ugg boots tall</strong> special teams for the Conchs, was dismissed from the team Tuesday afternoon and will miss the remainder of the season. The dismissal also marks the end of a standout career at Key West for Young, who is a senior and was one of the team's top contributors over the last three years.</p>

<p>Young had already been suspended for two games this season due to disciplinary reasons.</p>

<p>"It was for administrative disciplinary reasons," Conchs coach Jerry Hughes said of the dismissal, noting that it stemmed from <strong>discount ugg kids</strong> missing classes. "He's been given too many chances. He's done."</p>

<p>Young's dismissal couldn't have come at a worse time for the team. Key West (52, 11 District 163A) will leave the Keys for the first time this season Friday night to take on Miami Jackson (62, 11), the seventhranked 3A team in the state, with a state playoff berth on the line.</p>

<p>So far this season, in just six games, Young has 15 receptions for 280 yards, another 206 yards on the ground, has scored three touchdowns and has a teamhigh three interceptions on defense.</p>

<p>Despite his dismissal, Hughes said the team's morale has remained high, and the two practices this week without Young were two of the best defensive practices he's seen from his team all season.</p>

<p>"We're going to come together as a team and try to get it done," Hughes said of Friday night's game. "Football is not a oneman sport. It's not like baseball where <strong>wholesale ugg gloves</strong> you can have a guy throwing 100 mph, or basketball where you can have a 7foot center, or track where you can do your own thing. In football, <strong>ugg for men</strong> you have to have all 22 guys on the same page."</p>

<p>Michael McFadden will take Young's spot in the <strong>wholesale uggs shoes</strong> starting lineup Friday night at receiver opposite sophomore Clive Georges, who has emerged over the past few weeks as one of the Conchs' biggest threats. In the team's 3513 loss to South Dade on Oct. 16, Georges had a singlegame school record of 152 receiving yards on seven catches. Tight end Christian Stewart has also proved to be a bigtime target, as he has hauled in a touchdown pass in each of the last three games.</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to step it up," Hughes said. "That's the thing about situations like this. We'll see who steps it up."</p>

<p>While Hughes said his team will be ready to compete Friday night, he said he also realizes that Young's absence will certainly be felt.</p>

<p>"It does hurt us," the coach said. "But you know what? Life goes on. That's why we're in this thing. Football isn't only X's and O's, it's also about doing the right thing."</p>Articles Connexesï¼š
