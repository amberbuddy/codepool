<h1>Red Zone Woodland keeps coach's promise in showdown win ugg boots zipper over Naugy

 </h1><p>BEACON FALLS Woodland High football coach Tim Shea made a promise earlier this week. Friday night against Naugatuck, his team made good on it.</p>

<p>In the first annual George Pinho Memorial Trophy game before more than 2,000 fans, the Hawks held off the Greyhounds for a 2522 win and kept the prize in the hands of the team he loved.</p>

<p>George Pinho, a Naugatuck native, was a Woodland assistant coach who died suddenly in January. With George's brother, Tony, on hand to present the trophy, Shea said an already important game took on <strong>cheap ugg genevieve</strong> more meaning.</p>

<p>"We made a promise that it wasn't going anywhere," Shea said. "A lot of what George talked about is stuff we do. We talk about fearing the family. It's about us as a family and what we have to do to protect this family. I believe that George was looking down on <strong>dicount uggs xmas</strong> us tonight."</p>

<p>With the best seat in the house, George saw Woodland give a defensive effort that stymied a Naugatuck attack that had looked potent in the first three games of the season.</p>

<p>The Hawks (40) forced four punts including a failed fake punt and one that never got off with a botched snap and three turnovers on downs. They held the Greyhounds to 94 rushing yards and forced Naugy quarterback Jason Bradley to miss on 23 of his 39 attempts.</p>

<p>"We went with different groupings <strong>ugg boots zipper</strong> (on defense)," Jack Pinho said. "We just had to make sure we contained Bradley. Coach (Chris) Moffo did such a great job coaching us all week, and he deserves all the credit."</p>

<p>The two most important stops Woodland made came in the second half, minutes after Tanner Kingsley had hooked up with Taylor Tucciarone for a 6yard touchdown pass and an 1816 lead.</p>

<p>The Greyhounds drove inside the red zone, but the Hawks stopped them on downs to take over at the 16. Woodland then marched downfield, but was stopped by a Sean McAllen fumble at the Naugy 14, but the defense held for a threeandout. Bradley couldn't handle a low snap on the punt and Will Flormann caught him at the 7yard line to set up a firstandgoal opportunity.</p>

<p>"I thought we moved the</p>

<p>ball well, but we got jammed up near the goal lines," Naugatuck coach Craig Bruno said. "We both played a good game. We made a few mistakes we usually don't make, but that's football, and they're a good football team."</p>

<p>Three plays after the failed punt, Kingsley snuck into the end zone behind center Alex Varhol. Flormann's PAT kick gave the Hawks a 2516 lead with 8:02 remaining.</p>

<p>"That play came from halftime," Kingsley said of his 3yard scoring sneak. "I told Coach (Tim) Phipps what kind of looks I was getting and they had faith in me to get the ball into the end zone."</p>

<p>On the ensuing drive, the Hawks forced another turnover on downs when the 5foot8 McAllen locked down the 6foot5 Ryne Griesenauer for a fourthdown incompletion.</p>

<p>"I saw his height and I was a little shaken because I had never covered a wide receiver like that," said McAllen, who held Naugy's leading wideout to just three catches. "I knew if I covered him well and jumped for the ball, I'd be OK."</p>

<p>McAllen, a sophomore, also excelled on offense with 168 total yards. Seventyfive of those yards came on a pair of screen passes in the second half that kept Woodland drives alive.</p>

<p>"He's our guy," Shea said. "Sean <strong>ugg boots toddler size 5</strong> isn't afraid to make a play. Our screen game has gotten better over the years. A spread draws the blitz, and the screen game helped to keep them back."</p>

<p>Kingsley settled with short passes most of the night, going 31of41 for 302 yards and three touchdowns. He hit Mike Kenney <strong>ugg boots wholesale</strong> for a 9yard touchdown in the first quarter and struck Pinho for an 11yard score that gave Woodland a 128 halftime lead.</p>

<p>"They didn't really allow us to get the ball deep downfield because their corners were playing 10 yards off the line," said Kingsley, who connected with six receivers. "We were going to abuse them with the short passes and grind it out."</p>

<p>Tom Douty scored on a 12yard touchdown pass from Bradley with 1:35 remaining to cut Woodland's lead to 2522, but the Hawks' Chris McDonald recovered the ensuing onside kick and effectively ended the game.</p>

<p>In the postgame, with the Pinho Trophy in hand, the Hawks acknowledged the blackclad student section that made for what Kingsley said was a perfect night in his team's chance to honor their late coach.</p>

<p>"I can't even describe the atmosphere," Kingsley said. "We weren't going to lose this game."</p>
