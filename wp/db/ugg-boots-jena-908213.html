<h1>Probably Scare Seattle A ugg uk Little

 </h1><p>Before Friday's match, Philadelphia coach Peter Nowak said the cozy confines of JeldWen Field force teams into playing "pinball" in Portland. OK, well, if that's the case, the Timbers showed they indeed play with balls of steel by holding on for a 10 victory over the Union to stay perfect at home in MLS play and leap into a tie for second in the Western Conference.</p>

<p>Think these guys might've had something to do with it?</p>

<p>More after the jump, including thoughts on a huge (mental) victory for Portland, coach John Spencer's full postgame presser and EXTRA TIME links to read before you start focusing hatred northward.</p>

<p>I was a tad surprised last week when Spencer called out his team's mental composure and labeled it "soft" after the Timbers got into a bad habit of giving up early (and late) goals in bunches. It's always a bold move <strong>ugg boots jena</strong> for a coach to challenge a team's character via <strong>ugg uk</strong> the media, and I thought particularly for a team that's just stating to jell, it was a tactic that could blow up on the firstyear head coach.</p>

<p>Wrong. Based on what Portland's shown in its last two MLS matches, Spencer's challenge was heard loud and clear, and his Timbers are showing some serious grit against seriously good clubs. Yes, they have the home (sellout) crowd at their back, and that's tremendously important for momentum, inspiration and the like, but gripping tightly to 10 leads and not letting go (Not. Letting. Go.) says more about a team's character than jumping out to a 30 lead ever will. Clean sheets are the currency of tough teams, and Portland's team is looking tougher by the week.</p>

<p>The Timbers were physical <strong>cheap uggs classic tall</strong> and aggressive and didn't let the Union's kickback style lull them to sleep (though it might have had that effect on fans tuning in for "Soccer Night in America"). They stood onpoint until the final whistle (10 shots <strong>cheap uggs edmonton</strong> in the second half!), withstood Philly's late surge and showed they won't hesitate to throw down <strong>ugg hannen</strong> inside the goal if you collide with the keeper.</p>

<p>Spencer told the media he's "absolutely delighted" with the win, and I'm sure he feels similarly about his team's mental toughness. They're a long way from soft as they prepare for next week's Cascadia Cup clash with Seattle, and as the coach says in the video below, "We realize what a good team we're becoming."</p>Articles Connexesï¼š
