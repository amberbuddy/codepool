<h1>Inspirational composer motivates new

 uggs uk com reviews </h1><p>Writing, composing, <strong>wholesale uggs slippers</strong> and performing a song that pays homage to one of Vancouver's great composers  on what would be her 100th birthday  seems fitting for one of Barbara Pentland biggest fans.</p>

<p>Marcel Bergmann, a teacher and coach at Langley Community Music School, has spent the past few months preparing this yet untitled song, and will debut it later this month at the music school.</p>

<p>While his piece is not the same style of music that Pentland was known for, it was inspired by one of her songs, News, released in 1970. In this, she expressed outrage and horror around what kind of violent and horrifying stories the public was being deluged with through newspapers, radio, and television of the day.</p>

<p>He actually intertwines some multimedia clips from the news in with the music, noting that hunting out the audio clips for the project began back in about September, and took a large chunk of time.</p>

<p>Once that was in hand, Bergmann said he was then able to concentrate his energies on writing the music, which came together relatively quickly.</p>

<p>It's a "combination of different elements," that Bergmann said have him excited about its release. This piece was written for duelling pianos  and will be performed next weekend by himself and his musical partner and wife Elizabeth.</p>

<p>He has not been so inspired by a piece since 2010, when he released a homeless song in Calgary that incorporated singing and poetry readings by people living on the streets.</p>

<p>"This is a nice project that ties into an important composer," Bergmann told the Langley Advance.</p>

<p>Pentland is an integral part of Canada's history and of the country's music community. Although <strong>ugg boots made in china</strong> she died in 2000, this would have been her 100th year, and the Canadian Music Centre  which she helped found  provided Bergmann with a grant to pursue this piece of work.</p>

<p>In addition to unveiling this new Pentland tribute at the concert, <strong>discount uggs paypal</strong> Bergmann said he'll also perform an array of music next weekend from composers who inspired Pentland. Hhe is convinced doing so will put Pentland's work, and in turn his own work, in context.</p>

<p>As an aspiring young composer, Pentland was inspired by Anton Webern, Paul Hindemith, Igor Stravinsky, and Aaron Copland.</p>

<p>Consequently, Bergmann <strong>uggs uk com reviews</strong> said he has been inspired by this woman, her works, and her dedication to Canadian music.</p>

<p>He was honoured when commissioned to compose the new piece paying tribute <strong>uggs quakerbridge mall</strong> to Pentland and to perform it at LCMS  which he noted, is in possession of her grand piano and a few other pieces of Pentland memorabilia.</p>

<p>"I feel very fortunate. It's a very interesting project," said Bergmann, who has been performing a lot more around the Lower Mainland in recent months and is dedicating a lot of time to writing. He's hoping to focus more of his time in the coming year to working with the Langley music school, his individual students there, and the school's chamber music program.</p>

<p>In addition to Bergmann's tribute Saturday, Nov. 24, the school's former artistic director Ian Hampton will speak about Pentland, who's described as one of his dear old friends.</p>

<p>Then, on Sunday, Nov. 25, the school is hosting its creating composers program final concert.</p>

<p>Members of Turning Point Ensemble have been working with young composers at the school, to nurture creative expression through music.</p>

<p>The culmination of those efforts will be a concert, featuring works of young composers ranging in age from 12 to 20.</p>Articles Connexesï¼š
