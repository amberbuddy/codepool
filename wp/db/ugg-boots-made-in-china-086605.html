<p>I personally believe that Mr. Fischer was very frustrated with some students at Regis and he took out his frustrations on the student body. He didn't intentionally mean to say that about the whole school. I speak from experience, and there are "good" and "bad" kids at Regis, just like there would be at any other school across the country. When he addressed the school, however, he didn't just address the high school, he also addressed the middle school. I think the middle schoolers should have been removed. This didn't involve them.</p>

<p>I commend Mr Fischer for addressing the problem of cheating, disregard of the rules and of all things misbehaving in church. There are rules for a reason and if you break them you will face consequinces. I have a feeling that some of the kids that did the cheating thought they were above the rules and were not happy that they got in trouble for it. These were High School students who will soon be out into the real world. Do they think that society will let them get away with breaking the law and/or rules? Their parents won't always be there to defend them when they make bad choices. It's time to grow up or <strong>cheap uggs that are real</strong> pay up. Don't shoot the messenger on this one. I personally agree with his right to do this and I agree that he seems to have done this for the good of the school. It took a brave man to write something like this and I commend him for it. But unfortunately, it is newsworthy as he <strong>wholesale ugg purse</strong> is a leader of a local high school. Regis should not be immune from public scrutiny just because they are a private school.</p>

<p>I find this article interesting. I think it is sad that The Leader Telegram would actually write this as a "newsworthy" article, while they clearly only have one side of the story. I am questioning their source and the purpose for putting this article in the paper. Generally schools (both public and private) deal with these things on their own terms and according to their rules. I assume Mr. Fischer did just that. There are specific guidelines that all students are expected to follow. Schools put these rules in place so that they keep their students safe, as well as keeping the school itself safe from any mishaps. Of course there will be issues, and I think it sounds like Mr. Fischer tried to resolve it in a timely and effective manner. This article comes across from what seems to be a parent in denial of their child behaving in a manner in which was not acceptable or appropriate, and was then mad that Mr. Fischer did his job and what he is asked to do as principal. This article also makes it appear that those who were truly involved with this incident seem to think that just because they attend this school, that they are above the rules of the school, and can then get back at those that were actually doing their job, by attempting to bash them in the paper. Poor choice in "news", Leader Telegram. I am extremely disappointed with the staff person that chose to write this article, and am extremely disappointed in the adult who chose to cry to the newspaper instead of fixing problems at home.</p>

<p>My experience with Todd Fischer was when he was a principal at the OsseoFairchild school district. As a parent of multiple students (Catholics attending public school), I always found him to be a good communicator and forthright in his dealings. In fact, I often would contact Todd when others failed to respond because I could count on him to find me an answer and he <strong>ugg protector</strong> always came through. He also was a football coach for the middle school boys. I admired him then, as he not only taught the boys skills of the game, but emphasized good sportsmanship and that winning isn't the most important thing in sports, but the character that competition builds. Was glad my son had such a good role model in his life. Too bad Regis did not seize this as a "teaching moment" and use it as a means to begin the conversation about ethics. Letting Mr. Fischer go is sending the wrong message to teachers and staff about setting the expectation bar high. When our Catholic schools cave to the ways of the world, so goes the trend with the values in our society.[sad]</p>

<p>Regis is a wonderful school, with nice families and students. You may not like Todd Fisher, but to drag him and our school in the mud is blasphemy! Like Mr. Fisher or not, he is our school's principal! The true problem at Regis is respect! Or lack there of! We see it in sports all the time  play my kid if you want the dollars to keep the school running, not respect of the team and coaches. How do we expect to see the success if we <strong>cheap uggs</strong> don't let coaches coach, or in this case Principals lead? Regis has improvements to make  there are inconsistencies depending on which teacher catches the infraction and depending on if they have blinders on or not and that across the board lowers the standards and expectations for everyone! The same parents that helicopter in to try to save their kids. Teach your kids respect !! But lead by example. Whoever sent this to the LT should look in the mirror. I have several kids that have gone through Regis and 1 left therelet's unite not destroy a great school with great traditions! Maybe review Matthew 57! Thank you to Mr. Fisher, we honestly believe his heart was in the right place and unhappy to learn, 'the squeaky wheel got the grease' on this one  a few complained and threatened to withdrawal. While many more supported his efforts to make us aware. We are a Catholic High School  if we don't point out immortality how will we get to Salvation?!! We need to stand up to our children and say, that isn't OK! Or I am proud you are 't apart of that! TGIF! Have a great Rambler end to the year! Support or Principal  these undermining actions were hurtful to many and used a high power paintbrush, NOT all families were upset! Reporting could do better to fact check! And print news not GOSSIP!</p>Articles Connexesï¼š
