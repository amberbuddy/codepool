<h1>FSU defense shows overall speed  cheap ugg look alikes </h1><strong>uggs girls</strong> is well suited for spread offenses<br><br>TALLAHASSEE It took nearly a month for Florida State to face its first test against a potent spread offense.<br><br>FSU stifled thenNo. 25 Maryland's wideopen offense, which was tearing apart defenses during the first month of the season. The Seminoles shut out the Terrapins 630 and surrendered 234 yards of total offense, highlighting what new defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt's scheme is built for: Speed.<br><br>"It was a big change because Boston College wanted to run the ball downhill and Maryland wanted to get the ball to the edges," FSU linebacker Terrance Smith said. "Based off the speed we have on our defense, we like to run around and make plays out in the open field."<br><br>Boston College ran over FSU for 200 rushing yards and scored 34 points. There was no frills to the Golden Eagles' approach. Behind running back Andre Williams, the nation's leader in rushing yards per game, Boston College exposed an FSU defense that looked undisciplined and soft against the run. Brown's running ability. The Terps were averaging 226 rushing yards per contest.<br><br>Primarily using its nickel formation which replaces a linebacker with an extra defensive back FSU managed to run sidelinetosideline with Maryland's speedbased offense and limited the Terrapins to just 33 rushing yards.<br><br>"It was real good to actually see everything work together this <strong>discount uggs girls</strong> game, it actually shows growth," FSU safety Terrence Brooks said. "We never want to go at the same rate and it felt like we were going at the same rate those previous games."<br><br>Players admitted after <strong>cheap ugg look alikes</strong> the Boston College game that they were still adjusting to a change to defensive philosophy. Pruitt, in his first year at FSU, has overhauled the Seminoles' traditional 43 base defense with a multiplefront scheme.<br><br>Against Maryland, FSU appeared more focused and physical than in previous weeks, but the Seminoles also benefited from playing in a package that allowed some of their top playmakers to get out on the field.<br><br>Smith's athleticism was highlighted in the nickel package. Linebacker Christian Jones lined up on the edge and primarily rushed the quarterback. And cornerback Ronald Darby earned his first start of the year as fellow corner Lamarcus Joyner moved inward to guard slot receivers, acting as a more athletic linebacker.<br><br>"You match athlete with athlete and that's very critical," FSU coach Jimbo Fisher <strong>cheap ugg boots china</strong> said of the nickel formation. "That's a lot of learning on those guys because they have to learn the linebacker responsibilities. That's what we do on defense and one of the things I like."<br><br>FSU could rely heavily on the nickel formation against Clemson, which is led by dynamic dualthreat quarterback Tajh Boyd, a Heisman hopeful. Like Maryland, Clemson's offense is predicated on spreading out the field with its wide receivers and using an athletic quarterback to run the football.<br><br>"We know they do like to spread, they have a lot <strong>uggs amazon com</strong> of great receivers they like to use," FSU linebacker Telvin Smith said. "It may be the same game [as Maryland] but you never know.<br><br>"They could try to run the ball a lot, they could try to pass and playaction, we just have to go in with an open mind and try to get all the bullets ready."Sign me up for the following lists:<br><br>SPORTS  Orlando Sentinel Sports AlertsUCF  UCF Sports AlertsMAGIC  Orlando Magic AlertsRECRUIT  Orlando Sentinel Recruiting NewsNASCAR  NASCAR AlertsVARSITY  Orlando Sentinel Varsity AlertsFSU  FSU Sports AlertsUF  UF Sports AlertsArticles Connexesï¼š
