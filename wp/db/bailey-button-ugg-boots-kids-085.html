It does not depend upon observation, and it does not depend upon any postulate except rationality. International trade theorists have generally assumed that cost differences between countries arise from differences in the quality and availability of the factors of production and in the technology available for their use. The HeckscherOhlin Theorem [3], assumed that there were no differences of technology between developed countries, and that cost differences arise from international differences in the relative abundance of labor and capital (referred to as factor endowments). Based upon the law of comparative advantage, the theorem predicted that countries with relatively abundant capital resources would tend to export capitalintensive products and that countries with relatively abundant labor resources would export mainly laborintensive products. (the world's most capitalabundant country) exported laborintensive commodities and imported capitalintensive commodities. The law does not, however, depend upon that particular assumption: it depends only upon the existence of comparative advantage, whatever its source.
