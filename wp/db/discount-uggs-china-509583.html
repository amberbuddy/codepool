<h1>Haselrig heads UPJ Hall of Fame inductees The Tribune Democrat

 cheap uggs coupon code </h1><p>JOHNSTOWN As the most decorated athlete in the university's history, Carlton Haselrig seemed like a natural to be in the inaugural PittJohnstown Athletics Hall of Fame. The Johnstown native, who won six NCAA championships at PittJohnstown and later had attained AllPro status with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL, wasn't part of last year's class, many believe, because of his past troubles and legal issues away from the athletic arena that have been welldocumented on <strong>discount uggs china</strong> the local, regional and even national level. The oversight, based purely on athletics, has been corrected. Haselrig is among the sixmember Class of 2009, an honor he deserves based on his lofty achievements with the Mountain Cats. An appreciative and more mature Haselrig won't take this moment in the <strong>uggs with bows</strong> spotlight lightly. He apparently understands the significance of the Hall induction, perhaps much more than he would have decades ago when he rolled to a 14321 record on the mats from 1985 to 1989. "It definitely feels good to be honored by my university, the place I went to school and spent a lot of good years of my life," said Haselrig, who holds five UPJ alltime wrestling records. "As time went on I really didn't realize the things I accomplished there until now. It's really starting to sink in, the feats that coach Pecora and I were able to accomplish. A lot of lessons I learned on the mat helped me get through rough times in life. The things I learned in wrestling practice helped me get through rough patches. I knew to hang in there. I learned that from the sport of wrestling in general. To be a top wrestler, you'll go through a whole bunch of things. "It feels real good," he said of the upcoming induction. "I'm still trying to do good things with my life. I'm a father. My kids don't realize about the wrestling part of my life. It's <strong>cheap uggs coupon code</strong> something for them to see more than anything." Haselrig will join successful PittJohnstown coach Clyde Horner; men's soccer standout Joachim Knispel; baseball pitcher Paul Leonard; men's basketball player Dave Roman Sr.; and women's basketball player Mindy YoungGagliardi. The Hall of Fame ceremony will be held on Saturday at PittJohnstown's Living Learning Center. "My very first UPJ match sticks out in my mind. It was against a kid from Bloomsburg. The referee gave me a stall <strong>discount uggs in canada</strong> call in overtime," said. "The way coach (Pat) Pecora really blew up at it and wasn't afraid to be kicked out of the joint. From right then, that moment on, I knew how much this man believed in me and anything was possible. I knew we were going to have a great future." That future included six national championships  three at the Division II and three in Division I. Haselrig will be the last wrestler to achieve that milestone because the NCAA implemented a rule change prohibiting Division II champions from wrestling in the Division I championships. In wrestling circles, it's known as the "Carlton Haselrig Rule." "It was a belief in me. Coach believed in me," Haselrig, whose motto at UPJ was "Someone has to win. Why not me?" Roman played for PittJohnstown when the then twoyear school was located on Cypress Ave. in Moxham. The sharpshooter earned a spot on the University of Pittsburgh squad after scoring 1,446 points in less than two full seasons and doing so without the 3point shot. He holds the school record of 54 points in a game against Point Park in 1961 and the singleseason mark of 954 points in 196162, when he was a junior college AllAmerican. "It's exciting to be honored in your hometown," said who also is a member of the Cambria County and Western Pennsylvania sports hall of fames. "This is where it all started. The main thing was that the Pitt freshmen came up to Johnstown to play. I had no way of knowing what would happen in the future but I had a pretty good game against them and shot the lights out. They were like a Fab Five. It turned out that they didn't offer me anything right away." Roman enrolled in summer classes and was prepared to play for the St. Francis University. At least until Pittsburgh coach Bob Timmons visited him. "They called me down from the classroom and I went down and it was Bob Timmons from Pitt," recalled. "I made a big swallow in my throat and stepped back a little bit. I said I would come down to Pitt. His play earned No. 2 ranking on the alltime most memorable moments in the history of Pitt's Fitzgerald Field House when he hit a halfcourt shot against WVU in 196263. Still a coach who teaches shooting technique, Roman earned a national championship in the International Shootout in Las Vegas in 1998. His son Dave Roman Jr. is the Johnstown High coach. Horner played at PittJohnstown from 196469. He coached 36 years at UPJ and collected 633 wins, the most in school history, coaching <strong>uggs uk sale</strong> men's and women's basketball, volleyball, track, men's soccer and tennis. He helped start the nationallyacclaimed UPJ women's basketball program, leading the Lady Cats to a 362 record in his first two seasons. "Over the course of my career, I have received numerous awards," said. "But none that mean as much to me as this one. To be recognized for your accomplishments by your own 'people' is the high point of achievement in any field." Knispel played soccer from 198286 and also was the colorful Mountain Cat mascot in his spare time. In his first college game, Knispel scored four goals. He set a singleseason scoring record with 16 goals in 1984 and had 29 career goals. Army and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel with 21 years of service, including a 2003 tour in Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. "I feel honored to be recognized alongside these other talented and impressive PittJohnstown athletes," said. "I'm grateful to coaches (Pat) and (Tom) Watyka for pushing me physically and mentally during my college career." Leonard lettered four seasons in baseball and pitched the only perfect game in PittJohnstown history during his senior season and earned both victories in that doubleheader sweep over St. Francis in 1976. He is in his 31st season as baseball coach at Shade High School, where he also is the athletic director. "There have been so many halloffame worthy studentathletes at PittJohnstown," said. "I never gave it a thought that I would be considered, let alone selected. I am extremely grateful." YoungGagliardi is one of the mosthonored women's basketball players in UPJ history. She was NCAA II Champion National Player of the Year in 199192, when she also was selected as a prestigious Kodak AllAmerican as well as a GTE AllAmerican. Young scored 1,486 career points and had 577 assists at UPJ. "I have many fond memories of my time at PittJohnstown and to be honored by the university in this way is special to me," said YoungGagliardi, who resides in North Carolina.</p>Articles Connexesï¼š
